 <h1>Autobiography</h1>
 <p>My name is Ma. Angelie Salinas. I was born on December 7,2000 and the only child of my parents. Though, I have a cousin which I treat as my biological brother because my parents are the ones who raised him. My parents are Amado Salinas III and Yolly Salinas. My father is the one who's originally from this province, Pangasinan. My mother's hometown is in Eastern Samar. Our family are currently living here at Manaoag Pangasinan. </p>
 <p>I am currently a second year college student taking up Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. During my elementary education, I studied at Manaoag Central School. Then I completed Junior High School at Manaoag National High School and graduated Senior High School at PHINMA University of Pangasinan-Main.</p>
